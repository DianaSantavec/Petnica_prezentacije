* After the 2011 census the Australian Bureau of Statistics published who
the average Australian was: a thirty-seven-year-old woman who, among other
things, ‘lives with her husband and two children (a boy and a girl aged nine
and six) in a house with three bedrooms and two cars in a suburb of one of
Australia’s capital cities’. And then they discovered that she does not exist.
They scoured all the records and no one person matched all the criteria to be
truly average. As they rightly pointed out:
While the description of the average Australian may sound quite typical, the fact that no
one meets all these criteria shows that the notion of the ‘average’ masks considerable
(and growing) diversity in Australia.

* -Always hilarious, internet engineers have designated error code 418 as
‘I’m a teapot.’ It is returned by any internet-enabled teapots, which are sent a
request to make coffee. It was introduced as part of the 1998 release of Hyper
Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol (HTCPCP) specifications. Originally an
April Fools’ joke, connected teapots have of course since been made and run
according to HTCPCP. An attempt to remove this error in 2017 was defeated
by the Save 418 Movement, which preserved it as ‘a reminder that the
underlying processes of computers are still made by humans’.-
